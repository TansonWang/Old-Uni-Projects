Lmao I don't think half this stuff works so don't take my word on it

You can use it as a guide if you wish, if your guides tend to be drunk, blind, deaf and probably wants to die.

Lab 1 is working for the most part

Lab 2 is not working for the most part

Lab 3 is confirmed all working

Lab 4 is working but only part A and B

Lab 5 is working but needs confirmation

Project is working but the motorspeed is 0 and 'mot' is connected to pin 'ph8' for a variety of rasins that I won't bother explaining.
(11:41 08/14/19) Turns out it was a hardware issue so changing the motor speed caused the system to randomly either reset or jump to a random part of the code. After explaining and showing this to the lecturer, Hui Wu, ***before*** the assessment was due allowed him to rule that the project would not lose any marks for the motor not running.

Best of luck y'all
